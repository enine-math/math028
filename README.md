# Problem No. 28

## Number Spiral Diagonals

Starting with the number $1$ and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a $5$ by $5$ spiral is formed as follows:

<pre>
<b>21</b> 22 23 24 <b>25</b>
20  <b>7</b>  8  <b>9</b>  0
19  6  <b>1</b>  2 11
18  <b>5</b>  4  <b>3</b>  2
<b>17</b>  6 15 14 <b>13</b>
</pre>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is $101$.

## Part A

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a $1001$ by $1001$ spiral formed in the same way?

Update the function `answer()` in `solution.py` with your solution.

## Part B

Generalize the solution in Part A to find the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a $n$ by $n$ spiral formed in the same way. 

Update the function `solver()` in `solution.py` with your generalized solution.

## Instructions

Create a new directory in your math problem repo (math) called `math028`

Copy README.md and solution.py into `math028`

Share your solution by updating `answer()` and `solver()` in solution.py.
